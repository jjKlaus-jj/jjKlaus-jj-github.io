## Markdown Style Guide for Coding Notebooks

Follow this guide to keep your coding notebook **clear, consistent, and professional**.  
This ensures your notes are easy for you (and others) to read later.

---

## 🔹 Headings
**When to use:** Organize your notebook into sections (like days, topics, or projects).  
- `#` for the notebook title (use once at the top).  
- `##` for each day or major topic.  
- `###` for subsections (like "Notes", "Practice", "Reflections").  

✅ Example:


# My Coding Notebook
## Day 1
### Notes
### Practice

🔡 Text Formatting
When to use: Highlight important ideas or add emphasis.

Use bold for key terms or definitions.

Use italic for emphasis or side comments.

Use inline code for keywords, functions, or commands.

 

✅ Example:

**Class** = a blueprint for objects  
*Remember:* always test your code  
Use `System.out.println()` to print

 

💻 Code Blocks
When to use: Anytime you write multiple lines of code.

Inline code for short snippets.

Fenced code blocks with language for full examples.

✅ Example:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

🧾 Lists
When to use: Organize steps, notes, or key points.

Numbered lists for sequences or steps.

Bulleted lists for unordered ideas.

✅ Example:

1. Define the class
2. Write the main method
3. Test your program

Variables
- Loops
- Conditionals
 

✅ Checklists
When to use: Track progress on assignments or tasks.

✅ Example:

[x] Complete coding warm-up
- [ ] Finish project draft
- [ ] Reflect on learning

 

➡️ Blockquotes
When to use: Call out notes, reminders, or teacher comments.

✅ Example:

> 💡 Remember: Loops repeat code until a condition is false.

 

📊 Tables
When to use: Compare values, track progress, or organize data neatly.

✅ Example:

| Task        | Status   | Notes          |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Homework 1  | Done ✅  | Submitted      |
| Homework 2  | Pending  | Needs review   |

 

🔗 Links & Images
When to use: Add references, resources, or visuals.

✅ Example:

[Java Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/)  
![Markdown Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Markdown-mark.svg)

 

📂 Collapsible Sections
When to use: Hide solutions, extended notes, or extra details.

✅ Example:

<details>
  <summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>
  
System.out.println("Answer: 42");

</details>

 

📝 Footnotes
When to use: Add references or side notes without cluttering the page.

✅ Example:
